# Android Studio Troubleshooting for Ionic Capacitor Project

## Issue
When running `ionic cap open android`, the following error occurs:
```
Error: spawn /home/ihor/android-studio/ EACCES
```

## Attempted Solutions
1. Updated capacitor.config.ts to include Android Studio path:
```typescript
import type { CapacitorConfig } from '@capacitor/cli';

const config: CapacitorConfig = {
  appId: 'io.ionic.starter',
  appName: 'ionicApp',
  webDir: 'dist',
  android: {
    androidStudioPath: '/home/ihor/android-studio/bin/studio.sh'
  }
};

export default config;
```

2. Verified Android Studio executable permissions:
- Android Studio is located at `/home/ihor/android-studio/`
- The executable is at `/home/ihor/android-studio/bin/studio.sh` with executable permissions

## Next Steps to Try
1. Try running Android Studio directly to ensure it works: `~/android-studio/bin/studio.sh`
2. Check if Capacitor needs to be synced after config changes: `ionic cap sync`
3. Try setting the Android Studio path via environment variable:
   ```
   export CAPACITOR_ANDROID_STUDIO_PATH="/home/ihor/android-studio/bin/studio.sh"
   ionic cap open android
   ```
4. Check if there's a global Capacitor config that might be overriding the project config
5. Consider creating a symbolic link: `sudo ln -s /home/ihor/android-studio/bin/studio.sh /usr/local/bin/studio`

## Current Environment
- Project location: /home/ihor/study/ionicApp
- Android Studio location: /home/ihor/android-studio
